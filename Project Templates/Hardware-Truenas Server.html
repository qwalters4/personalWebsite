<h2>Truenas Scale Home Server</h2>
<p>
    Setting up a Truenas Scale server has been one of the best learning opportunities I've had. The server was built and setup originally 
    as a netowrk drive to store pictures and files that I wanted to offload my personal machine. It has since snowballed and become a sandbox 
    where I get to learn and try new things.

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>
    When I decided I wanted to explore the idea of a home server, the only experience I had was building and running a truenas for a previous employer 
    for their own storage needs. I had planned to look at used servers with enterprise hardware but soon discovered how expensive it was for 
    how little performance I would be recieving. Instead I went the route of used enthusiast hardware like Intels High-End Desktop, or HEDT, platform.
    A Skylake or newer architecture was prefered since that was the last big improvement Intel had made at that point, and I wanted 10G networking as 
    well. This landed me on the Skylake-X architecture and a X299 motherboard. Very few X299 boards were made and fewer had 10G. Luckily someone local 
    was selling a bundled i9 7900X and an ASRock X299 board with 10G onboard for cheaper than any other combos I had seen till then. Storage was cheap 
    and accessible from my previous employer, a hard drive reseller, and the drives were personally tested by me. I ended up with 10 data drives and 2 
    cache drives. The data drives were 4TB HGST SAS drives from an Oracle datacenter and the 2 cache drives were 512GB Samsung Gen 4 NVME SSDs. The data 
    drive were then connected to a 4 port LSI SAS controller.

<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>
    In order to provide some redundancy and the best performance I chose 3 vdevs each in RAIDZ1 along with 1 hot spre that could be swapped out automatically 
    if any issues were detected. To provide high read speeds for more demanding tasks the 2 NVME drive were setup in RAID0 as an Level 2 ARC cache. For 
    Networking I have server connected to the network via a 1G connection and my personal machine is connected directly through the 10G connection. These 
    choices allow me to often saturate the servers 10G networking connection during transfers and provide fast enough random read and write response that 
    I can play demanding games directly off of my SMB share.

<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>
    As I mentioned previously the main purpose was originally to be a simple large network drive for storage and maybe plex if i was feeling adventurous. 
    This is now one of the best tools at my disposal for learning new technologies and skills. Currently the machine is also hosting 3 docker images, a 
    postgresql database, a .NET web API, and this website which uses the web api and database.
