<h2>Home Network</h2>
<p>
    This is an ongoing smaller project of mine. Since I am currently renting there isnt anything permanent or really exciting done. 
    At home I currently have A Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro Managing the network and acting as a hub for my personal machine, home server, 
    and partner's machine. Wifi is taken care of by a Ubiquiti U6 Pro and a bridged Netgear Nighthawk if I need a faster connection to 
    my server than a device's wifi can provide. Any smart devices that I own are controlled and managed through Google Home.
